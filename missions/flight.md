> The mission of defining a mission is never simple, and it is not easy to coordinate around coordination. What is the purpose of governance? As we have learned, several missions are necessary to effectively organize.

This page will introduce our plans to explore dynamics of rewarding contributors with tokens in various token systems. Ultimately, the main goal is to build sustainable \(meta\) processes for supporting more and more Governauts who answer important questions.

### Meta Processes

Essentially, these are processes about processes. For example, the Governauts need processes for communication. Thatâ€™s why our team formed a Mission Control to decide how to decide which processes are useful and impactful \(and how\). Just imagine a room full of project coordinators guiding fleets of ships exploring the space of token governance.
