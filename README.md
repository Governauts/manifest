# Token Governance Research

## Where are we?

Exploring a multiverse of token governance! Join our community of Governauts collaborating on various research projects. You may discover opportunities to learn, build, and earn by participating and contributing to this knowledge commons \(and others\).

Our purpose is to sustainably coordinate missions for anyone working on related projects in the field of Token Engineering. Ultimately, the association of Governauts will create a map of governance constellations for various blockchain ecosystems.

### Prime Directives

1. Research Output
2. Experimentation
3. Connectivity

### Objectives and Key Results

* [x] raise funds via [Gitcoin Grants Round 10](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2978/incubating-governauts)
* [x] discuss potential research questions / topics
* [ ] release manifest and iterate on the content
* [ ] organize a series of events to build awareness and engagement
  * [ ] event 1: TBD
  * [ ] event 2: TBD
  * [ ] event 3: TBD
* [ ] conduct research initiative: September to November 2021
* [ ] launch Governance DAO\(s\) to coordinate missions for Governauts

## Background

Following the [Open Web Governance Challenge](https://metagov.github.io/open-web-challenge/), organized by [The Metagov Project](https://metagov.org/), leaders from the interdisciplinary field of Token Engineering held a meeting to discuss potential collaborations. What emerged is a team building support systems for new research projects designed to improve understanding of \*decentralized\* governance. Together, we will identify common problems and related questions, then potentially launch an experimental Governance DAO for the purpose of supporting researchers, called Governauts.

As a means to that end, we raised $2,759 from 724 contributors via Gitcoin Grants! We are so grateful to everyone who made that happen üíñ

### Meta Governance

Of course, we must decide how to decide... That requires considering the impact of any decisions to be made, before choosing any specific mechanisms. We started from curiosity about potential research topics and questions, always remembering every assumption is based on assumptions.

For example, do we actually need to vote?

#### **Pertinent Questions:**

* Who has a voice?
* What privileges underlie decision making power?  
* Who has experience or expertise?
* What are the power structures and dynamics?
* Who will be affected by decisions?

Funds are currently held in a wallet controlled by the Token Engineering Academy, which provides an efficient structure to this research group. Leaders of that organization represent Mission Control, and our plan is to leverage a DAO to support Governauts exploring the complex space of token governance.

You might even call it a multiverse, given there are many dimensions of governance:

* Social
* Economic
* Political
* Institutional
* Technical
* Cultural
* Legal

Overall, the vision is to increase capacity and autonomy for global and local systems of value. We believe decentralization gives more people control of their data, money, and the power of governance. However, it does not happen without serious tradeoffs. Rather than trying to eliminate any centralized powers that be, Governauts embrace polycentricity! Making room for different kinds of decision making enables multiple ‚Äúcenters‚Äù to emerge.

* Participation --- Delegation
* Consensus --- Consent
* Accountability --- Fairness
* Transparency --- Privacy
* Responsibility --- Freedom
* Efficiency --- Effectiveness
* Equity --- Inclusivity
* Code --- Culture

Naturally, it is never simple!

## **Launchpad for Governance Research Projects**

Among other important questions, we must answer the following to explore the most sustainable approach to rewarding contributors.

### **Who are the Governauts?**

Governauts can be anyone who is adding value to the field of Token Governance.

Led by Ground Control, we formed an experimental ‚ÄúCircle‚Äù on Coordinape, and we aim to include more participants in decisions re: structure and processes.

### **What is our mission?**

Sharing knowledge and resources in order to generate insights from a variety of perspectives. We promote better understanding of relevant issues through multidisciplinary research efforts, and experimentation. Transparent collaboration facilitates coordination around ecosystem objectives. Key results include funds / resources gathered, experiments conducted, surfaces mapped, connections built, and solutions documented.

### **Why does it matter?**

Governauts coordinate projects in order to establish a sector of Token Engineering focused on developing best practices / principles for token governance. Hopefully, this enables more people to benefit from cryptoeconomic systems. That means unifying the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù through multidimensional value flows.

_**Most importantly, we will work on real challenges in the space, applying Token Engineering tools and frameworks in order to further develop toolkits for Governauts.**_

### **How can you participate?**

Engage with Governauts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GovernanceDAO), and join our growing community on [Telegram](https://t.me/GovCommons). All are welcome to contribute ideas for projects, workshops, experiments, and more!

Thanks for being here! Let us know any feedback :\)
